# Challenge-3
Pass Generator

#<PPassword Generator Website>

## Description

What was my motivation?
   Adding a password generator to your digital portfolio is a great way to showcase your programming skills and demonstrate your ability to create useful tools.
    

Why did I build the project?
   Once youâ€™ve created the password generator, you can add it to your digital portfolio by creating a new project page and including a link to the code on GitHub or another code-sharing platform. This will allow potential employers or clients to see your work and assess your skills.

What did it solve
    You can also password-protect your portfolio to ensure that only authorized users can access it. Plus you now have a very usefull tool whenever you need a new strong password.

    What did I learn?
         The addEventListener() method is a recommended way to register an event listener, as it allows adding more than one handler for an event.
